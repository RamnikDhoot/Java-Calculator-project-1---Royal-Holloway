This is a calculator that has two modes, Infix and Reverse polish.
To use this calculator you have to select the mode you want to use then input an expression. You then press calculate and your answer will be output into the result box.
This is the first release of the calculator, there is no functionality to input expressions yet.
None of the elements in the GUI work but this is just to show how it would look.
