These are the second release notes so they only contain the results of testing.
The calculator is now working with the GUI but only in reverse polish notation.
1. Usability testing: 
The GUI is the same as before but is now functioning. There are no tool tips to help users and the GUI colours may be hard to see for some.

2. Documentation testing: There is a README file which explains the functions of the calculator and the release notes explain the changes from the previous version.

3. Configuration testing: 
This does work in a different OS. It was tested in NoMachine. There is still no configuration section in readme.md
